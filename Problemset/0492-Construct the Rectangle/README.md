# 492. Construct the Rectangle
For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

```
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
```

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

#### Example:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 4
<strong>Output:</strong> [2, 2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
</pre>

#### Note:
1. The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
2. The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.

## Solutions (Rust)

### 1. Solution
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn construct_rectangle(area: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut w = (area as f64).sqrt() as i32;
        while area % w != 0 {
            w -= 1;
        }
        vec![area / w, w]
    }
}
```
