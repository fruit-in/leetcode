# 858. Mirror Reflection
There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls.  Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered `0`, `1`, and `2`.

The square room has walls of length `p`, and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance `q` from the `0`th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.  (It is guaranteed that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.)

#### Example 1:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> p = 2, q = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.

#### Note:
1. `1 <= p <= 1000`
2. `0 <= q <= p`

## Solutions (Ruby)

### 1. Mathematical
```Ruby
# @param {Integer} p
# @param {Integer} q
# @return {Integer}
def mirror_reflection(p, q)
    a, b = p, q

    while b != 0
        a, b = b, a % b
    end

    if p / a % 2 == 0
        return 2
    elsif q / a % 2 == 0
        return 0
    else
        return 1
    end
end
```

        let mut a = p;
        let mut b = q;

        while b != 0 {
            let tmp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = tmp;
        }

        match (p / a % 2, q / a % 2) {
            (0, _) => 2,
            (1, 0) => 0,
            (_, _) => 1,
        }
