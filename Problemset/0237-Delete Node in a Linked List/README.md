# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:<br>

#### Example 1:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,1,9]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are given the second node with value 5,
the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
</pre>

#### Example 2:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,5,9]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You are given the third node with value 1,
the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
</pre>

#### Note:
* The linked list will have at least two elements.
* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
* Do not return anything from your function.

## Solutions (Python)

### 1. Solution
```Python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```
