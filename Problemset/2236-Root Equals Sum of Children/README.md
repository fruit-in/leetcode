# 2236. Root Equals Sum of Children
You are given the `root` of a **binary tree** that consists of exactly `3` nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.

Return `true` *if the value of the root is equal to the **sum** of the values of its two children, or* `false` *otherwise*.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/08/graph3drawio.png)
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [10,4,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 10, 4, and 6, respectively.
10 is equal to 4 + 6, so we return true.
</pre>

#### Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/08/graph3drawio-1.png)
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [5,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 5, 3, and 1, respectively.
5 is not equal to 3 + 1, so we return false.
</pre>

#### Constraints:
* The tree consists only of the root, its left child, and its right child.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solutions (Python)

### 1. Solution
```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def checkTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        return root.val == root.left.val + root.right.val
```
