# 2022. Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array
You are given a **0-indexed** 1-dimensional (1D) integer array `original`, and two integers, `m` and `n`. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with `m` rows and `n` columns using **all** the elements from `original`.

The elements from indices `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**) of `original` should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices `n` to `2 * n - 1` (**inclusive**) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return *an* `m x n` *2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible*.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/26/image-20210826114243-1.png)
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> [[1,2],[3,4]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.
</pre>

#### Example 2:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> [[1,2,3]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The constructed 2D array should contain 1 row and 3 columns.
Put all three elements in original into the first row of the constructed 2D array.
</pre>

#### Example 3:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> []
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 2 elements in original.
It is impossible to fit 2 elements in a 1x1 2D array, so return an empty 2D array.
</pre>

#### Constraints:
* <code>1 <= original.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
* <code>1 <= original[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
* <code>1 <= m, n <= 4 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solutions (Rust)

### 1. Solution
```Rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn construct2_d_array(original: Vec<i32>, m: i32, n: i32) -> Vec<Vec<i32>> {
        if (m * n) as usize != original.len() {
            return vec![];
        }

        original.chunks(n as usize).map(|a| a.to_vec()).collect()
    }
}
```
