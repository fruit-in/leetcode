# 1742. Maximum Number of Balls in a Box
You are working in a ball factory where you have `n` balls numbered from `lowLimit` up to `highLimit` **inclusive** (i.e., `n == highLimit - lowLimit + 1`), and an infinite number of boxes numbered from `1` to `infinity`.

Your job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number. For example, the ball number `321` will be put in the box number `3 + 2 + 1 = 6` and the ball number `10` will be put in the box number `1 + 0 = 1`.

Given two integers `lowLimit` and `highLimit`, return *the number of balls in the box with the most balls*.

#### Example 1:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> lowLimit = 1, highLimit = 10
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Box Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...
Ball Count:  2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0  0  ...
Box 1 has the most number of balls with 2 balls.
</pre>

#### Example 2:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> lowLimit = 5, highLimit = 15
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Box Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...
Ball Count:  1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 0  0  ...
Boxes 5 and 6 have the most number of balls with 2 balls in each.
</pre>

#### Example 3:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> lowLimit = 19, highLimit = 28
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Box Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ...
Ball Count:  0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2  0  0  ...
Box 10 has the most number of balls with 2 balls.
</pre>

#### Constraints:
* <code>1 <= lowLimit <= highLimit <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

## Solutions (Python)

### 1. Solution
```Python
from collections import Counter


class Solution:
    def countBalls(self, lowLimit: int, highLimit: int) -> int:
        counter = Counter(sum(map(int, str(x)))
                          for x in range(lowLimit, highLimit + 1))

        return max(counter.values())
```
